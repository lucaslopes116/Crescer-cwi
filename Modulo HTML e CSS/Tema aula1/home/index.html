                    <p class="semNada"><span id="diferentao">H</span>ypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard
                        markup language for creating
                        web pages and web
                        applications. With Cascading Style <span id="ajeitaParagrafo">Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
                        technologies for the World Wide Web.</span></p>

                    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                        objects
                        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
                        create
                        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
                        lists,
                        links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
                        brackets.
                        Tags such as <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> directly introduce
                        content into the page. Other tags such as <code>&lt;p/&gt;</code><code>...&lt;p/&gt;</code>surround
                        and provide information about document text and may include other tags as
                        sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content
                        of
                        the page.</p>

                    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
                        the
                        behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
                        The
                        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has
                        encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>


                    <p class="direita">In 1980, physicist <u>Tim Berners-Lee</u>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
                        prototyped ENQUIRE, a
                        system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
                        proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the
                        browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
                        engineer
                        Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
                        formally
                        adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in
                        which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

                    <p class="direita">After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML
                        Working
                        Group,
                        which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as
                        a
                        standard against which future implementations should be based</p>
